# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation


## Description of Design Choices 

The choice that me and my partner ultimately ended up choosing was the maze design where the Finch robot goes through a maze with a series of obstacles. Our code demonstrated a series of turns and movement to navigate the maze, ending off with a "victory song" being played from the device. 

## Challenges Faced and Solutions 

A challenge that was faced was in regards to the simplicity of our code as we met the requirement of making the robot work efficently, however the code was very sequential and not demonstrating some aspects of CSA that wer have learned. The route that was teken to fix this was adding an inheretence aspect along with various methods to make the program more complex. 


## Future Enhancements 

If the nature of this project was difference and we had more time in terms of formulating a program, I believe that adding more senory- centered aspects to the project could be developed as well as adding more charateristics to  what the robot does prior and after.
